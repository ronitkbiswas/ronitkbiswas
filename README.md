# Ronit Kumar Biswas

Builder by instinct. Operator by experience.  
I focus on execution, systems, and fundamentals — both in business and in code.

## About Me

- Entrepreneur with hands-on experience running profitable businesses
- Strong background in JavaScript and web fundamentals
- Currently sharpening full-stack skills by building real, small, focused projects
- Believe in learning by building, breaking, and rebuilding

I prefer clarity over complexity and results over noise.

## Technical Focus

- JavaScript (ES6+)
- HTML, CSS
- Browser APIs (LocalStorage, Fetch, DOM)
- Git & GitHub
- Basic React (learning in progress)

## What I’m Doing Now

- Strengthening JavaScript fundamentals
- Building small projects to reinforce concepts
- Pushing clean, readable code to GitHub consistently
- Preparing for larger frontend and full-stack projects

## Philosophy

- Fundamentals first, frameworks second
- Simple code > clever code
- Consistency beats motivation
- Progress is measurable
