# Hi, I’m Ronit 👋

I build practical web applications with JavaScript and React, focusing on clarity, fundamentals, and real-world behavior—not tutorial fluff.

I’m currently strengthening my core JavaScript knowledge (DOM, events, state, storage) and applying it by building small but complete projects.

---

## 🧠 What I’m Working On

- JavaScript fundamentals (DOM, events, localStorage, async)
- React basics (components, state, props)
- Turning small ideas into finished, usable apps

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Languages:** JavaScript (ES6+), HTML, CSS
- **Frontend:** React (learning)
- **Tools:** Git, GitHub, VS Code
- **Concepts:** DOM manipulation, event delegation, localStorage, async/await

## 📁 Projects

| Project | What It Does | Key Concepts |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| Notepad App | Add, delete, persist notes | localStorage, events |
| Weather App | Fetch & display live weather | API, async/await |
| JS Mini Apps | Small focused exercises | fundamentals |

> Repos focus on understanding, not copy-paste code.
